				<h2>About Me</h2>
				 <p>I am a driven professional currently taking steps to transition from a career in the non-profit sector into front-end web development. As a life-long learner that's passionate about
					bringing a meaningful digital content experience to a diverse audience,
					I incorporate design thinking into my everyday work to bring the user
					the best possible experience.</p>
					<p>I'm currently pursuing an online degree with Treehouse and am on track to graduate with a certificate in their Front-End Web Development track. In my free time I enjoy getting outdoors, especially hiking, running, and outdoor photography.</p>

				<h2>My Background</h2>
					<p> After graduating from Rochester Institute of Technology with a
					B.S. in Museum Studies and Syracuse University with an M.A. in Museum
					Studies I became the Collections Manager at Genesee Country Village and Museum.</p>
					<p>In that position I was given the duty of creating and managing an online platform for the museum's online collection. It was through that opportunity that I found my interest and passion for coding. Being an RIT alumna, I was always surrounded by opportunities to learn coding languages but I never got the chance to pursue them. It wasn't until I was given a chance in my professional career that I realized how much thought, care, and design-thinking went into creating a usable and accessible website. I unexpectedly fell in love with it. </p>
				 <p>So I am here today, trying to transition my skillset and soaking in every ounce of knowledge I can to truly move into a field that can challenge and excite me every day. Please feel free to check out my GitHub account to see my latest projects.</p>
