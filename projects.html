				public and possessed interesting functions, histories, and stories
				attached to them.</p>

		<h4>Genesee Country Village and Museum Virtual Exhibitions</h4>
					<p>As the Collections Manager, I was tasked with creating and launching a new virtual exhibition space for the museum's collections.
						These are some of the exhibitions that I curated and co-curated.</p>
					<p><a href="http://gcvmcollections.org/vex3/index.htm" target="blank">
						Conrad Kuehles Collections: A German-American Family's Story</a></p>
					<p> <a href="http://gcvmcollections.org/vex4/index.htm" target="blank">Silver: An American Art Form</a></p>
					<p> <a href="http://gcvmcollections.org/vex7/index.htm" target="blank">
						Reminiscing in the Parlor: Leisurely Viewing Stereographs</a></p>


			<h4>Preserving Family Hierlooms</h4>
					<p> A presentation I compiled to present to the general public on how to
						preserve material culture artifacts. It included pictoral examples
				of material to help them identify material breakdown, defining terms used in
				preservation, and suggestions for proper storage material.
				I created partnerships in the community to enrich the experience through
				donations of archival material for the attendees to take home.</p>
					<p>This presentation was given in November 2019.</p>


				<h4>Skeptical Gaze: How Photomontage Blurs the Lines of Reality</h4>
							<p>This exhibit centers around the idea of applying skepticism to visual
									imagery regardless of the era or age of the photographs. Techniques
									that manipulate images, such as photomontage, have been extensively
									used throughout the modern analog film photographic process and continue
									 to be used in a prolific capacity within the digital photography realm
										with programs like Adobe Photoshop. This exhibition specifically
										connects contemporary ideas about skepticism towards visual imagery
										with traditional darkroom techniques as a way to encourage the audience
										to assess their trust and belief in what visual representations they are
										consuming. Skeptical Gaze: How Photomontage Blurs the Lines of Reality is
										an arrangement of photographs that use both fine art photography and mass
										media produced photography as a vehicle to begin this conversation.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				This exhibition opened for Fall 2019 at Syracuse University Art Galleries. Find the
				information<a href="https://galleries.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SUArt_Fall2019_Newsletter_hires.pdf" target="blank"> here.</a></p>
				<h4>Integrating Language Learning in Museums: Developing Cultural Tolerance in an Increasingly Diverse Society</h4>
					<p>This research centers around the notion and implmentation of foreign language integration in cultural heritage institutions
						through exhibition design. For decades foreign language education in American formal school settings that has seen a consistent
						decline in both public and private schools of all levels. However, language transcends all cultures and relates to all physical
						objects and ideas, exposure to new languages should be emphasized as a crucial aspect of education, access, and increasing
						cultural tolerance in a diverse society.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						This research was presented at the 2019 Popular Culture Association/American Culture Association's Annual Conference and the 2019
						Museum Association of New York's Annual Conference.</p>


			<h4>The Power of After-Hours: Young Adult Engagement and Programming in Museums</h4>
			<p>This project explores the cultivation of an ever deepening relationship between young
				adult audiences (ages 21-40) and museums and cultural institutions through the use of
				special event programming. Museums are turning to after-hours events to capture this
				audience’s attention, developing them as a mode of communication to solidify connections
				between the institution and young adults. In this research I draw on three case studies
				in the Rochester, New York area and conduct data analysis of guest surveys provided by
				the Rochester Museum and Science Center to create recommendations for museums and other
				cultural institutions. </p>

			<h2>Community Outreach</h2>
			<h4>Americans Who Tell the Truth at Syracuse University</h4>
					<p>Robert Shetterly's <i>Americans Who Tell the Truth</i> portrait show came to
						Syracuse University in November 2018. I was thrilled to be the Collections Manager
						 on this project. During
						this time I traveled to Maine to collect 240 paintings, managed 20 student
						volunteers during installation, and managed the database and condition reported
						the pieces from start to finish.</p>
						<p>Check out the article written by Syracuse University News<a href="https://news.syr.edu/blog/2018/11/27/museum-studies-students-and-faculty-bring-238-piece-americans-who-tell-the-truth-exhibition-to-life/" target="blank"> here</a>.</p>
